# Software-Automation-Test-QA-Final

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my code is functional, I develop comprehensive unit tests that validate both the expected and unexpected behaviors of my software. I follow principles like boundary testing, black-box testing, and negative testing to anticipate edge cases. To ensure security, I will make sure to validate input data early, enforce immutability where necessary (e.g., protecting IDs), and utilize consistent exception handling to prevent unintended behaviors.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I break down user requirements into solidified feature limitations, such as maximum lengths for input fields (e.g., 10-character contact IDs, 20-character first/last names). I then enforce these limitations through both the object constructors and validation logic, which ensures that the system behaves consistently with user expectations.

How do I approach designing software?
I choose to adopt a modular and test-driven approach. I design small, isolated classes focused on single responsibilities (e.g., ContactService managing contacts) and validate them with focused unit tests. I emphasize simplicity, maintainability, and clear validation of requirements through iterative development and continuous testing.
